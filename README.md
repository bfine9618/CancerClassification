# CancerClassification

The goal of this lab was to determine the liklihood of cancer given a genetic profile. A more robust version of KNN with varying neighbor types by individual was implmented. In addition, I used graph fourier transforms and netowrk analysis to improve the classification. I completed this lab for my Signal and Information Processing (ESE 224) course.
